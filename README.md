### DRAGON BOOK DATABASE
This is a database created for the table on this website: selters-hideout.com.ua and later made public through this repository to facilitate direct community participation. It is meant to provide a community driven alternative for the GoodReads tables, which would also provide more visibility for the books that are not present on the platform. If you want to add more books to the table or correct some of the data, you are welcome to submit a pull request, but only once you familiarized yourself with the submission guidelines. 

#### SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
- Only books that are about dragons or feature dragon PoV can be added to the list, meaning that dragon rider stories like "Eragon", and shifter stories where the protagonist spends most of the narrative in a non-dragon form are excluded. 

- Books hosted on platforms like RoyalRoad or Archive of Our Own are allowed, but they have to pass a certain size threshold and be finished or regularly updated. 

- For required data structure of the document refer to the example.txt included in the releases section, as well as the document itself.

- When adding any links, don't forget to strip them of tracking. For example, in case with Amazon links, it's everything in the link after and including "/ref=".

- Before submitting a pull request with your changes, make sure to thoroughly check your submission for syntax errors. I suggest using GitHub's built-in web editor - github.dev. 

- The maintainers retain the right to decline any pull request.
